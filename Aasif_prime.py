# Write a Python program to check whether a given number is Prime or not.

a = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if a <= 1:
    print("The number is not a prime number",a)
else:
    for i in range(2, a):
        if a % i == 0:
            print("The number is not a prime number",a)
            break
    else:
        print("The number is a prime number",a)
